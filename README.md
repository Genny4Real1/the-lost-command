## About the Creator

My name is Genny4Real1. I'm an Italian Europa Universalis IV player with almost 3,000 hours in the game and a huge fan of the world written by the great Jaybean and the developers of the [Anbennar](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1385440355) mod. I'm the creator and sole developer of this mod. While I have worked on other projects before, this is my first real contribution to the EU4 modding community.

## About the Mod

The Lost Command is a mod designed to create a crossover between real history and the world of the Anbennar submod.
The mod (will) include:
- A new nation with an original, fully-fledged mission tree, called The Lost Legion (more details in the story section).
- New events and content for existing nations in the vanilla game, ensuring that the addition of the new nation is as immersive as possible (considering that the mod introduces a fantasy nation into a historical sandbox simulator).
- Several mechanics inspired by those in the Anbennar mod, including: a racial tolerance system, a magitech system, new trade goods etc (to be developed over time).  


## Story: The Lost Legion’s Journey
**TO BE EXPANDED ON**

The Lost Legion of Hobgoblins is a group of Command troops sent to conquer the Nomsyulhan region—the land where the Eagle Hobgoblin fled to—in order to enslave its inhabitants and reconnect with their lost brethren. However, the expedition did not go as planned. They became lost in the Badlands Desert, suffering heavy casualties due to attrition. Eventually, the legion stumbled upon an ancient site housing a precursor monument. Unaware of its true nature, they entered the facility to shelter themselves. One clumsy and goofy orc accidentally activated a portal, which transported the entire legion to Earth-specifically to the mountains of the Tibetan Plateau. 
This is the exact moment where we will pick up the story, on the 11th of November 1444 in the world of Europa Universalis IV.
